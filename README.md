**Philosophy**
- use libaries or pre-trained models as much as possible
- focus on extension rather than reimplementation

**Langauge choice and philosophy**
- PYTHON: for training/ML heavy tasks will give me broad access to already established algorithms
as well as let me port local code onto cloud platforms for efficiently
- RUST: for implementation and model execution, using rust tensorflow or other libraries
- Catch 22's: if i'm generating data from rust to be used in a model, this data needs to be readily accessible
for example: rendering using rust and passing to python 
rust and python: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3664124/how-to-use-rust-with-python-and-python-with-rust.html#:~:text=The%20most%20widely%20recognized%20project,with%20Python%20packaging%20and%20bindings.
